# gs-frontend-challenge

I’ve chosen <strong>Vue.js 2</strong> for the frontend framework, combined with TypeScript for type safety and Vuex for efficient state management. For unit testing I’ve integrated Jest.
You can explore a live demo of the solution, hosted on Vercel, by following <a href="https://gs-frontend-challenge.vercel.app/" target="_blank">this link</a>.

To run the solution locally, simply clone or download this repository, then execute the following commands:

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Run all tests with jest

```
npm run test
```
